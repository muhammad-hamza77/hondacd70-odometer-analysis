# Mileage Measurement System â€“ Honda CD 70

This project analyzes the purely mechanical odometer in the Honda CD 70 motorcycle. It explores how rotational motion from the front wheel is converted into linear distance, using gear mechanisms and a calibrated worm gear system.

## ðŸ§  Topics Covered:
- Odometer gear system design
- Speedometer cable and gear ratios
- Mileage calculation via wheel circumference
- Real-world application of mechanical kinematics

## ðŸ“Œ Summary:
- System type: Fully mechanical
- Wheel circumference used: 1.357 m
- Rotation to distance logic: 737 front wheel rotations = 1 km

## ðŸ”§ Skills Used:
- Mechanical System Analysis  
- Gear Mechanism Understanding  
- Engineering Calculations  
- Technical Reporting  
- Vehicle Kinematics
